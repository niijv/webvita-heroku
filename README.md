Web-Vita and Publishing App 
=========

A minimal framework for a searchable personal blog site and online CV based on [Flask]. 

This application is designed to be hosted on [Heroku].  A version ready to be hosted on [OpenShift] can be found [here](https://github.com/niijv/webvita). 

Nevertheless, the Postgres database can easily be replaced with sqlite3 and then be hosted on [pytonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) or some other cloud-hosting service, if that is more your style.
